# CVE-2025-47907: Go stdlib database/sql Postgres Scan Race Condition
# Error: "database/sql: Postgres Scan Race Condition" in Prometheus binary (Go v1.24.5)
# Reason: This vulnerability affects Go's database/sql package when scanning Postgres query results
# Why Ignored: 
#   - Our Prometheus setup uses time-series storage (TSDB), not Postgres database
#   - Prometheus doesn't use database/sql package for its core functionality
#   - Vulnerability only affects applications that scan Postgres query results concurrently
#   - Our monitoring stack: Prometheus → TSDB → Grafana (no Postgres involved)
# Impact: Zero impact on our monitoring infrastructure
# Status: Fixed in Go 1.23.12, 1.24.6 - will be resolved when Prometheus updates Go version
# Date Added: 2025-01-04
